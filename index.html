	At the age of four, Babu visited the sets of the Telugu film Needa (1979) where its director Dasari Narayana Rao shot a few sequences of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother Ramesh.[non-primary source needed] Needa marked his debut as a child actor.[20] In 1983, he acted in Poratam (1983) upon being requested by its director Kodi Ramakrishna.[21] He went on to act as a child artist in the films Sankharavam (1987), Bazaar Rowdy (1988), Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989). He played a dual role in the film Koduku Diddina Kapuram (1989). Babu then appeared in Bala Chandrudu (1990), and Anna Thammudu (1990).[21][additional citation(s) needed]

In 1999, Babu made his debut as a lead actor with the romantic comedy Rajakumarudu, directed by K. Raghavendra Rao and co-starring Preity Zinta. The film was commercially successful, and people began referring to him with the title Prince.[22] The film had a 50-day run in 80 centres and a 100-day run in 44 centres. Rajakumarudu collected a share of ₹10.51 crores from Andhra Pradesh.[23] It was dubbed in Hindi as Prince No. 1 and in Tamil as Kaadhal Vennila.[24] The film was again dubbed and released theatrically in Tamil during January 2017 as Ivan Oru Thunichalkaran.[25] For his performance, he received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[26] He starred in two films the following year – Yuvaraju and Vamsi.[citation needed] Following their poor performance at the box office,[citation needed] he starred in Krishna Vamsi's Murari (2001). He regarded Murari an important film in his career and the role he played in it one of his favourites.[27][failed verification][28] Murari was a commercial success[citation needed] and earned him the Nandi Special Jury Award, in addition to his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[26].Idlebrain.com rated the film 3.5/5 stating, "The credit for the success or failure of this film should go to Krishna Vamsi. This film is bound get a little bit of dissent from the viewers of C class areas. But, this film is classic masterpiece for the class audience and highly recommended for the Mahesh and Krishnavamsi fans. This film will be a good fare for the people if they watch this film with no expectations. Just watch this film to experience Krishna Vamsi paint the silver screen with his classic strokes."[29] Though his 2002 releases Takkari Donga and Bobby performed poorly at the box office,[citation needed] his performance in the former fetched him his second Nandi Special Jury Award.[26]

Babu had two film releases in 2003, the first one being Gunasekhar's Okkadu co-starring Bhumika Chawla, which went on to become the highest grossing Telugu film of the year collecting ₹25–30 crores at the box office.[30] He won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[31].A critic from The Hindu called the film "An opportunity for director Gunasekhar to make a mass movie with an artistic touch. And for Mahesh Babu to assert his versatility".[32].The other release was Teja's Nijam co-starring Rakshita. The film was noted for introducing Dolby EX surround system in Telugu cinema.[33] Though the film was a commercial failure,[34] Babu received praise from critics for his performance in the film, with Vijayalaxmi of Rediff.com calling him the only reason to watch the film's second half which she termed "a routine tale of vendetta".[35] He won his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, in addition to his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[36].Idlebrain Jeevi in his review gave a rating of 3 out of 5 for the movie with concluding remarks "Overall, it's an average film that has chances to become hit because of the Teja's mass-attracting episodes and Mahesh Babu's brilliant portrayal of the character
In 2004, Manjula produced his next film,[citation needed] Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. While its simultaneously shot Tamil version New featuring a different cast proved to be commercially successful, Naani flopped at the box office.[27][non-primary source needed] He received his third Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in his next film, Arjun, directed by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh.[39].The film released on 18 August 2004[40] and was successful at the box-office.[41].The film was screened at the International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section. This was Keerthi Reddy's final acting performance prior to her retirement from the film industry.[42] He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu (2005), co-starring Trisha Krishnan, whose script had been approved back in 2002 before the production of Naani and Arjun had begun.[43][non-primary source needed] It emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.[44][45] The film proved to be a major boost for Babu's career as he received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to fetching his second Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the role of a hired assassin.[46] The movie collected a share of ₹22 crores at the box office.[citation needed] Idlebrain.com gave it a rating of 3.25/5 and mentioned Mahesh Babu is stylish and brilliant as professional killer.[47]

He then collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film Pokiri, which was jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.[48] Made on a budget of ₹10 crore and shot within six months,[49] the film grossed over ₹67 crore at the box office and became the highest grossing Telugu film of all time by the end of its run.[50][better source needed] It was screened at the 7th IIFA Awards held in Dubai.[51]It held that position until 2009 when Magadheera pushed it to second place after its nine-day run.[52] He received high praise for his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu opining that "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him effortlessly to reclaim the title of a star, overshadowing his questionable career choices of late".[48] He won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[53] That same year, his next film, Sainikudu, co-starring Trisha, was released, but despite much hype, it flopped at the box office.[54].A critic from Rediff.com wrote that "Nonetheless, Sainikudu can be watched at least for its premise of letting the warrior in each individual surface, and the fact that it is done with the idea of motivating people to do something for their fellow humans".[55].

The following year saw Babu acting in the film Athidhi, co-starring Amrita Rao, marking her Telugu debut. The film was produced by Mahesh Babu's's brother Ramesh.[56] UTV Motion Pictures acquired the film's distribution rights for ₹18.5 crore, which became its first Telugu film venture.[57].Jeevi of Idlebrain.com praised the film's first half while criticising the last thirty minutes of the film.[58] In 2008, Babu provided voice-over for the film Jalsa directed by Trivikram Srinivas.[59]

After Athidhi's release, Babu took a break from films for seven months; two months later, he signed Khaleja, but the break was unintentionally extended for two years due to several delays. During this time, Babu's grandmother and his wife Namrata's parents died. Krishna was worried about Babu's career as the film's shoot was delayed for so long.[60][non-primary source needed] Upon release, Khaleja received mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial failure in India.[61] However, it managed to perform well at the overseas box office.[62] Rediff gave a 3 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless.[63] The film is included in the list of "25 Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade" by Film Companion.[64]

	s an Indian actor and producer known for his work in Telugu cinema. He first appeared in the 1979 film Needa when he was four years old.[1] He continued to perform as a child actor in several films, most of which featured his father Krishna.[2] Following his role as the titular protagonist in Balachandrudu (1990) while still a child, his career went on hiatus so he could concentrate on his education until taking on his first lead role as an adult in the 1999 film Raja Kumarudu, for which he won the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[3][4] Afterwards, his career stagnated until successes like Murari (2001), Okkadu (2003) and Athadu (2005) brought him fame.[2][5] In 2006, he played a gangster in the Puri Jagannadh-directed action-thriller Pokiri. The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time,[6][7] and according to Vogue India, cemented Babu's reputation as a "superstar".[8]

In the wake of the failures of Sainikudu (2006) and Athidhi (2007), Babu took a long-term break from cinema for personal reasons.[8][9] His next project, the fantasy action film Khaleja, was released in 2010 after significant delays.[10] In 2011, he starred in Dookudu, which became the first Telugu film to gross over ₹1 billion.[11] Businessman (2012), his next film, was well received and became one of the year's highest grossing Telugu films at a time that was particularly harsh on other big-budget productions.[12][13] The following year, Babu co-starred alongside Venkatesh in the critically and commercially acclaimed drama film Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,[14] which was considered the first Telugu multi-starrer in decades.[15][16] He then featured in Sukumar's 2014 psychological thriller film 1: Nenokkadine.[17] Although Babu's performance as a schizophrenic rock star was lauded by critics, the film itself received mixed reviews and failed to recover its budget.[18][19] Aagadu, his next release that year, suffered a similar fate,[20][21] despite the film's opening gross being his highest at the time.[22]

His 2015 action-drama Srimanthudu was a commercial success and earned Babu his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu as well as his eighth Nandi Award in any category, the most by any individual.[23][24][25] The film was also his first as a producer.[26] His subsequent film Brahmotsavam (2016) and his first bilingual film Spyder (2017) under-performed at the box office.[27][28] The actor's next role was as an inexperienced chief minister in Koratala Siva's Bharat Ane Nenu (2018).[29] The film was the year's second highest-grossing Telugu production and critics praised Babu's performance.[30][8] His following two films, Vamshi Paidipally's action-drama Maharshi (2019) and Anil Ravipudi's action-comedy Sarileru Neekevvaru (2020), also made substantial profits despite receiving mixed reception.[31][32][33] Babu's 2022 film Sarkaru Vaari Paata also received a mixed response, however, his performance was appreciated by critics.</p>

	Babu married his co-star Namrata Shirodkar on 10 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, Mumbai during the shooting of Athadu (2005).[215] The couple's first child was born on 31 August 2006 at the Global Hospital in Hyderabad.[216] The boy was named Gautam.[217] On 20 July 2012, Shirodkar gave birth to a girl whom they named Sitara.[218] Before her delivery, they preserved her stem cells using stem cell banking to ensure a better immunity level.[219]

Babu is the fourth child in a family of five children. His elder brother Ramesh Babu was a film producer and was also an actor. Mahesh Babu's eldest sister Padmavathi is married to Galla Jayadev, an industrialist and Member of the Indian Parliament from the Telugu Desam Party.[220] His elder sister Manjula is a film producer, director, and an actress.[citation needed] Priyadarshini, his younger sister, is married to Sudheer Babu, who later made his debut as an actor in Telugu cinema.[221]

Telugu actress and filmmaker Vijaya Nirmala was Babu's step-mother; actor Naresh is his step-brother.[222]

Philanthropy
Babu gives 30% of his annual income to charities, and most of his philanthropic activities are unpublicised because he prefers them to be so.[223] He joined Farhan Akhtar's Men Against Rape and Discrimination (MARD) campaign in August 2013 and lent his voice to the Telugu version of a poem written by Javed Akhtar.[224] He was signed in 2013 as the goodwill ambassador of Heal-a-child Foundation, a non-profit organisation that offers financial support to the parents of terminally ill children to help with the cost of medical treatment.[225] In October 2014, he donated ₹25 lakh to a relief fund run by the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh for reconstruction of areas destroyed during Cyclone Hudhud. Krishna and Vijaya Nirmala later donated ₹25 lakh to the fund.[226]

Jayadev announced in February 2015 that Babu would adopt Krishna's native village Burripalem, a minor panchayat in Tenali, and would address basic needs of the community such as potable drinking water and better roads and drainage systems.[227] Later, Namrata Shirodkar was quoted saying that they had adopted Siddapur village in Mahbubnagar district upon consultation with Telangana's Rural Development minister K. T. Rama Rao.[228]

Legal issues
In September 2004, Babu and director Gunasekhar attended a rally organised by his fans at Warangal for the promotional activities of Arjun. He and his fans allegedly raided two video libraries and assaulted their owners who were circulating unauthorised CDs of the film. Cases under IPC section 448 (criminal trespass), section 427 (mischief) and section 366 (kidnap) were registered on him, who was the principal accused, and five others.[229] Later, a delegation from the Telugu film industry, including his father Krishna, Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Allu Aravind and D. Suresh Babu, approached the then chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy to intervene in this case. Regarding the issue, Babu said that while cases were booked against him on "the basis of wrong information," not a single case had been booked against the person dealing in bootlegged CDs, which he found the "funniest" thing.[230] Actor Pawan Kalyan openly supported Babu throughout the episode.[231] Babu surrendered in the district court in September 2004 and appeared before the court again in April 2006. Babu and the others were exonerated after the final hearing in July 2006.[232]</p>
